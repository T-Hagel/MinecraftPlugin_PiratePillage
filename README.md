A Minecraft plugin based off of an event created by www.WoodyCraft.net

This project was started in December 2015 and is no longer in development. I may return to this one day, however.

This project was intended to be a base for an arena and player-party system that I had been working on. After working on my Warfare plugin, I had come up with an arena and player-party system that could be re-used for different plugins.
